Description: This is originally a port of stream.js (http://www.streamjs.org/) a small library that enables
        you to use a new, cool data structure. It is named "stream" and it looks like an array, but
        with capabilities of handling infinite elements and even make mathematical operations with them.
        It is based on lazy evaluation.
